# GraphQL

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

</div>

> NRN promotes the usage of GraphCMS vendor.

GraphCMS is a 3-in-1 managed platform that provides you with:
- A CMS to manage your data visually (back office)
- A GraphQL API to manipulate your data
- A database (hidden behind the GraphQL API)

It's very simple to use and provides many benefits, especially for small businesses, because you don't have to manage any infrastructure.
It may not fit all needs, but you can use any GraphQL API anyway because it's based on the GraphQL [Specification](https://spec.graphql.org/).
You can always start with it and use your own self-managed GraphQL server later on. There is no lock-in.
