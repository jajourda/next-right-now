# Concepts

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
This section explains the different concepts around Next Right Now.

We recommend to follow the given order to go through them all.

You don't have to read/understand all of them, pick those that seem related to your needs.

> We strongly recommend reading both **Variants** and **Environments and Stages**, because they're both pillars of NRN and will be necessary anyway.
