## Contributing about documentation

Our documentation lives in the `docs/` folder. It is generated by Github Pages.

Only the master branch generates the online documentation. It is available at [https://unlyed.github.io/next-right-now/](https://unlyed.github.io/next-right-now/)

It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) behind the wheel, and [`just-the-docs`](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme for Jekyll.

---

### Installing Jekyll locally

In order to contribute to the docs, you may need to install Jekyll locally (especially for non-trivial changes).
Jekyll needs Ruby binary.

1. Install and configure Jekyll on your computer, follow [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
1. Once Jekyll is installed, you can install all Ruby gems using `yarn doc:gem:install`
1. Once gems are installed, you can run the local Jekyll server by using `yarn doc:start` which will start the server at localhost:4000

---

### Configuring Jekyll properly

Jekyll configuration uses 2 different files.
- [`docs/_config.yml`](docs/_config.yml) used by Github Pages
- [`docs/_config-development.yml`](docs/_config-development.yml) used by your local installation

There are a few, but important differences between both. The custom configuration must be written at the top of each config file.
The shared configuration must be written below.

> **N.B**: If you add custom/shared configuration, don't forget update both config files, as needed.

### Known issues

- Using `yarn doc:start` will rebuild the whole documentation but it's slower. Using `yarn doc:start:fast` won't rebuild the whole thing and it's faster.
  If you're working on the navigation menu, be warned the fast mode won't apply changes and your menu links won't update.

## Requesting a new Variant

If you need a variant that isn't supported yet, you can request one through Github issues.

- Please check first if there isn't an **existing request**, you can use the [Github label `"request variant"`](https://github.com/UnlyEd/next-right-now/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22request+variant%22) to filter them out.
- Please check first which variants [**won't be worked on by the NRN team**](https://unlyed.github.io/next-right-now/concepts/variants.html#which-variants-arent-being-considered) and must come from contributions.
