# Quick start

This short tutorial will explain how to perform a super quick local installation (for local-only testing purpose, without deploying anything online)

This tutorial uses the [**`v1-ssr`**](../getting-started/pick-variant) variant, which is the ~~simplest~~ _only one_ available at this time.

> It doesn't really matter if the selected variant fits your needs, the goal here is to give your a tour of what NRN can do for you, as quick as possible.

## Step by step installation

> **Tip**: Using now@17+ is required for CI to work properly when deploying to Zeit, but we don't care about that as we just want to get started quickly.
