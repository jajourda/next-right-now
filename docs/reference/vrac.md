> **Tip**: You can enable **Locize in-context editor mode** in order to localise your static content, by appending `?locize=true` to the url, see [https://nrn-customer1.now.sh/?locize=true](https://nrn-customer1.now.sh/?locize=true) _(this is only enabled in development and staging stages, not in production)_

> **Tip**: You can change **which customer is started by default** by changing the [`./now.json`](./now.json) symlink (ie: `ln -s ./now.customer2.staging.json ./now.json`)

> **Tip**: If there are tools that you don't need/like, read our [guide about how to remove them](README_HOW_TO_REMOVE.md).
